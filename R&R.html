        <h1>Basic Rules And Regulations:</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
          Mineral Concession Rules:<br />
          Mining operations require obtaining mineral concessions or leases from
          the relevant state or central government authorities. The Mines and
          Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, and its subsequent
          amendments govern the grant of mineral concessions.<br /><br />
          Environmental Clearances:<br />
          Mining projects must obtain environmental clearances under the
          Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. This involves conducting
          Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and obtaining approvals from
          the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) or
          State Pollution Control Boards.<br /><br />
          Forest Clearances: <br />If mining activities are located in forested
          areas, forest clearances under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980,
          are required from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate
          Change (MoEFCC).<br /><br />
          Safety Regulations:<br />Compliance with safety regulations outlined
          in the Mines Act, 1952, and related rules is mandatory. This includes
          provisions for safety of workers, mine design, ventilation, use of
          explosives, and prevention of accidents.<br /><br />
          Labour Laws:<br />
          Mining operations must adhere to various labour laws and regulations
          concerning wages, working hours, safety measures, and welfare of mine
          workers.<br /><br />
          Royalty Payments:<br />
          Mining lease holders are required to pay royalty to the government
          based on the quantity and value of minerals extracted.<br /><br />
          Community Engagement:<br />
          Mining companies are often required to engage with local communities,
          address their concerns, and contribute to local development under
          Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.<br /><br />
          Regulation of Specific Minerals: Different minerals (e.g., coal, iron
          ore, bauxite, limestone) may have specific regulations governing their
          mining and transportation. For example, coal mining is governed by the
          Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015.<br /><br />
          Health and Environmental Standards: Compliance with health and
          environmental standards related to water usage, air quality, land
          reclamation, and waste management is essential.<br /><br />
          Regulatory Authorities: The Ministry of Mines at the central level and
          State Departments of Mines and Geology at the state level are the
          primary regulatory authorities overseeing mining activities in
          India.<br />
